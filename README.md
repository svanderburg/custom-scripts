custom-scripts
==============
This repository contains a variety of custom scripts that I use for my own
personal system administration tasks. They are very opiniated and may not
be useful to everybody. Use them at your own risk.

Scripts
=======
Currently, this repository contains the following utility scripts:

* [gitlike-rsync](./gitlike-rsync) is a script to synchronize the contents of
  directories using a Git-like workflow.
* `archivegitrpos` is a script that archives all Git repositories in a directory
  and puts the corresponding tarballs in a specified folder.
